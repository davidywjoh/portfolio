<strong> Scratch Project </strong>
<img class="float-right" src="Images/footballscratch.PNG" width="320px" height="400px;">
<u>(August 30th, 2018 - September 7th, 2018)</u>:
For our scratch game in CSP my partner and I decided to create a moving football themed game. The sprite can only move left to right and the aim of the game was to get in contact with the football before it hit the ground. By each level the drop speed of the footballs would get faster and once the first football hit the ground the game would be over. I learned how to use scratch well and how to design and work timings in scratch. In the project I was in charge of most of the timings and movements and my partner was in charge of the more visual and character aspect of the project. The project overall was a good expierience to learn how to cooperate and learn to use scratch.

<strong>Image Manipulation Project</strong>

<u>(March 4th, 2019 - March 22nd, 2019)</u>:
My partner and I chose the option to be a photography team, to edit photos for families. We picked pictures of families and took them and added edits such as color, our logo, and cool borders, and paterns. We had difficulty at some times having to add these edits to the photos and making sure it all looked good. But as a team we were able to create these edits and take these pictures and improve them.

<strong>Pizza Party App</strong></strong>
<img class="float-right" src="Images/mitappinventor.PNG" width="320px" height="400px"></center>
<u>(September 18th - October 11th)</u>:
My partner and I decided to make a pizza ordering app for our MIT App Inventor Project. It was an fantasy pizza ordering app that we tried to simulate and make equivalent to a real pizza ordering app. We faced many difficulties in trying to link our code for the app to google spreadsheets. Everything in the code had to be very specific and one little mistake could cause the whole app not to work. However me and my partner did every step slowly one by one and with our cooperation we finished a well working pizza ordering app.
