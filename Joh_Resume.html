            Career Goals
          </h4> 
          <p>
          In the future I would like to work in the medical field, specifically a pediatrician. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Education
          </h4>
          <p>
          I am currently a 9th grader attending Dublin High School, located in Dublin. I am in the graduating class of 2022 and plan to attend all 4 years. 
          One college I am most interested in is John Muir Medical College. I am interested in the medical field and this is a college focused and based off of the medical field.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Volunteer Experience
          </h4>
          <p>
          Throughout March 2017 to current day I have been actively part of KPA a bookclub organization and I mainly lead bookclubs for younger children, but also help out with events for volunteer hours. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Skills
          </h4>
          <p>
          I am currently taking my 3rd year of mandarin and know how to have a fluent conversation. This could be helpful for my job because pediatricians have a variety of patients. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>
            Extracurricular Activities
          </h4>
          <p>
          Outside of school I play AAU basketball in which my team last year qualified for top 3's at a big tournament in reno. I also as a hobby love build items with my dad because he is an engineer.
