            <p class="col-md-6">My name is David Joh and I am currently a 9th grader attending Dublin High School. In the future I am hoping to be working in the medical field, I am hoping I can become a pediatrician. I want to become a pediatrician because I love to work with kids and I also want to help kids with allergies just as I had. Helping kids like myself who have lots of allergies and having to be cautious because of these allergies. 
            <br>
I have specified my goal to being a pediatrician because they work with kids and I enjoy being with kids. I currently lead a bookclub for first graders and also volunteer at events for kids, that is related to the bookclub called KPA (Korean Parents Association). Within the first half of high school I have managed to gain 20 volunteer hours just related to this association. Through all this, participating in my basketball club, and taking hard classes such as CSP (Computer Science Principels), I have learned that if I keep trying and pursuing my goal everything gets easier and I can teach myself how to succeed.
<br>
Being a pediatrician requires a lot of work but knowing that if I chase my goal and pursue it I can succeed. Many obstacles help me learn characteristics and teach me how to improvise and work with my environment.
